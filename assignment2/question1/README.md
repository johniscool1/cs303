This program was made in visual studio.
there will be a menue to run the various functions.

main is located in assignment1.cpp

I implemented all the functions in the class.h and class.cpp.

Added Try and catch blocks to the modify the number using and index and adding a number at the end of the list. Due to the way it is coded, I had to take in the numbers as strings to detect if they were charectors or digits. Then check if the are negative for the index and make sure they do not exceed the list size. I also had to throw errors becuase whouldn't originally error.
